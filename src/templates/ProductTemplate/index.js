/*
---------------> EXPLANATION OF ' shopifyProduct(shopifyId: {eq: shopifyId}) ':

export const query = graphql`
query MyProductQuery($shopifyId: String){
    shopifyProduct(shopifyId: {eq: "Z2lkOi8vc2hvcGlmeS9Qcm9kdWN0LzcwNDg3ODg2Mzk5MjI="}) {
        title
      }
}
`

1. On gatsby-node.js we created the page generator with a for Each loop. Within that function we iterate through every product and we get as prop in context the shopifyId of each product.
2. A url is also generated for each product. Therefore we have a url for each product and a shopifyId for each product.
3. Here we do a query to look for a specific product and we do it by telling the query we want the product with the shopifyId that the user underhood choses when entrying to a page product.
*/


/* ---------------> EXPLANATION OF getProductById:

PRODUCT WITH ALL VARIANTS DATA INSIDE.

Each product has its variants inside. A variant is not an independent product. It is just a variant.
A product is as an object with its variants inside. A variant does not constitute a product itself
but its part of a product.

--> const { getProductById } = React.useContext(CartContext);
--> Receiving the function getProductById. It comes from CartContext and
it contains a product object when giving its id.

--> getProductById(props.data.shopifyProduct.shopifyId).then(result => {
--> Here we are getting a specific product object by within the () indicating the id of the one we want.
The id is gotten from the graphQL above as we asked for the shopifyId within the function.

--> setProduct(result)
Here we are saving the product object into the useState 'Product'.


When rendering:

-->{product?.variants.map((variant, id) => (
--> We iterate with a map to each variant to get the title which is its color.
product useState contains the product object.


Within this product we can find its variants, its availability, etc
*/


/*
---------------> EXPLANATION OF selectedVariant

We want that when we choose a variant from the drop-down menu we get the data
of that variant (its title, price, etc).

--> We set a useState called selectedVariant.

--> Within the getProductById we change the value from the state selectedVariant
from null to the first variant[0]. Its inside the getProductById function since
in that function we get all the product data.

--> On the <select> tag we add an onChange event that will trigger a function
called 'handleVariantChange'.

--> Within that function we need to get the data of the selected variant
and save it on the state 'selectedVaraint'.

We use the function of the state setSelectedVariant and there we have to get
the selected variant.

To get it we use the state 'product' (which contains the product given an id
from getProductById) and we access its variants.

KEY: There we apply the 'find' method and we look for a variant.id (from the product object)
that is equal to the e.target.value . Remember that in the .map we added a prop called
'value' and we added that its value is equal to the id of the variant.

Therefore when selecting a variant in the dropdown menu <select> the find method will
find and save in the state SelectedVariant a product.variant.id (from the several it has)
that is equal to the target.value remembering that the value of the prop 'value' is
the variant.id since this is how we specified in the .map:

 {product?.variants.map((variant) => (
                    <option key={variant.id} value={variant.id}>

It compares all the id's the object product has with the id of the value.target
And then the variant that matches this find is saved in the state selectedVariant.

CHANGE: const newVariant added.
